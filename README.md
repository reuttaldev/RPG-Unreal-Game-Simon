## Introduction

This project is a 2D RPG-style video game, developed using Unreal Engine 5.4.2 and C++.  
The concept revolves around a music-based puzzle game in 2D, drawing inspiration from the childhood classic
Simon.

A player awakens in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by thick walls and dim lighting. There is one door to exit the
mystery room, but it is locked.  
The player can make their way through several rooms, each room serving as a game level. To progress to the next
one, the player must solve a puzzle placed on the door.  

The lock plays a short melody. It contains 4 buttons (red, green, blue, yellow) that when pressed, emit a single note.
To open the lock, the player must accurately replicate the short melody using these buttons.

For those struggling, a "hint" button is available which replays the melody.
The game's difficulty progressively increases, introducing variations such as changing each note button (so players
will have to rely on their listening skills and not visual memory), altering the melody's scale, or adjusting the number
of notes to be played.

The scripts are located in the Source folder. Full code documentation can be found at [refman.pdf](refman.pdf).
